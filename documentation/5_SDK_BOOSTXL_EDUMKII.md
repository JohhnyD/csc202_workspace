## 🧑‍💻 Final Project by Ryanne Geiger

The goal of this project was to create a **Software Development Kit (SDK)** for the **BOOSTXL-EDUMKII BoosterPack**, designed for use with the **LP-MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad**. The SDK aims to save future students time by providing a set of reusable code samples, initialization routines, and helper functions to interface with various components on the BoosterPack.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This SDK is a work in progress. Contributions and improvements are welcome.

## 📦 What is the BOOSTXL-EDUMKII?

The **BOOSTXL-EDUMKII** is an educational BoosterPack developed by Texas Instruments. It features a wide variety of onboard sensors and peripherals that make it ideal for teaching and learning embedded systems concepts. It connects to TI LaunchPad boards and supports hands-on development in C, real-time programming, and sensor interfacing.

### Key Features:
- 3-axis accelerometer  
- Microphone  
- Joystick  
- RGB LED  
- Push buttons  
- Temperature sensor  
- Light sensor  
- Buzzer  
- 128x160 color LCD (ST7735S)  
- Servo motor headers

This hardware platform provides a compact, affordable way to experiment with embedded system applications.

##  🧱 Module Overview

### 🧩 Accelerometer  
3-axis accelerometer connected via ADC:

| Axis | ADC Module | Channel |
|------|------------|---------|
| X    | ADC1       | CH6     |
| Y    | ADC0       | CH7     |
| Z    | ADC1       | CH5     |

---

### 🧩 Microphone  

- Connected to **ADC0**, **Channel 5**

---

### 🧩 Joystick  

| Function  | ADC Module | Channel |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| X-Axis    | ADC0       | CH2     |
| Y-Axis    | ADC1       | CH1     |
| Select    | GPIO       | PA26 (Pin 59) |

> Joystick Select is handled via the push button interface (see below)

---

### 🧩 Push Buttons  

> **Important Jumper Configuration:**  
> - **Remove Jumper J18**  
> - **Move Jumper J22 down by 1 pin**  
> 🧩 This configuration enables the BoosterPack push buttons but disables UART functionality.

| Button          | GPIO Pin       |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Button 1        | PA11 (Pin 22)  |
| Button 2        | PA12 (Pin 34)  |
| Joystick Select | PA26 (Pin 59)  |

---

### 🧩 LCD Screen  

- The display is driven by the **ST7735S** LCD controller  
- Graphics support provided by `gfx.c` for basic shapes such as rectangles  
- Original display interface code contributed by **Andrew Deford**

---

### 🧩 Buzzer  

- Audio output driven using PWM  
- Support for tones and simple melodies  
- Open-source melody examples include:
  - Harry Potter Theme  
  - Super Mario Theme  
  - It's a Small World

> PWM and initialization code improved with help from Andrew Deford

---

### 🧩 PWM Timer Mapping

| Peripheral | GPIO Pin | Timer Channel |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Buzzer     | PB4      | TIMA0_C2       |
| RGB Red    | PB1      | TIMA1_C1       |
| RGB Green  | PA28     | TIMG7_C0       |
| RGB Blue   | PA31     | TIMG7_C1       |
